# Popular Movies

Popular Movies is an Android app project that gets a list of Movies from The Movie Database (TMDB) and displays their posters and information. Movies can be sorted by Most Popular, Highest Rated, and Upcoming. The Homepage looks like this:

Upon clicking one of the posters, you are taken to a details page that gives you the name, release date, rating and synopsis of the movie.
